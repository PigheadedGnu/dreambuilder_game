"If you can imagine it, you can build it."

Dreambuilder is my attempt to give the player pretty much everything 
they'll ever want to build with, and all the tools they should ever need 
to actually get the job done. This game, at its base, consists of the 
standard minetest_game, minus a couple of mods that I don't like, with a 
number of minor things changed, and a whole boatload of extra mods added 
on, many of which have themselves been tweaked from their default 
states.

What's changed?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 

* The Undergrowth modpack along with the Moretrees mod and their main 
dependency, the Plantlife Modpack, add a very large dynamic to your 
landscape (as a result, they will add mapgen lag).

* The standard inventory that comes with minetest_game has been 
overridden in favor of RealBadAngel's Unified Inventory mod. That means 
that if you're playing this in creative mode, your stacks are NOT 
infinite (and they shouldn't be).

* The default bones mod has been removed, with extreme prejudice.

* Stu's split-limb player model replaces the default one.

* sfan5's desert cobble has been added.

* The default lavacooling code has been supplanted by better, safer code 
from my Gloopblocks mod. That mod also provides stone/cobble --> mossy 
stone/cobble transformation in the presence of water.

* Paramat's Snowdrift mod is included to give the world some weather! 
Rain and snow will fall, and snow will accumulate on suitable surfaces. 
The snow and rain paramaters have been tweaked a bit to my taste :-) .

* An extensive selection of administration tools for single-player and 
server use are included, such as areas, maptools, worldedit, xban, and 
others.

* And lots, LOTS more.  You'll just have to play and discover what this 
game has!
